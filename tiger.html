          The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Asia. It is known for its powerful body, striped coat, and solitary behavior. Tigers are apex predators and primarily hunt large ungulates such as deer and wild boar. They are territorial and require large areas of habitat to support their prey requirements.
